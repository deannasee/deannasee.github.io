              <p>While working towards my Computer Science concentration at UVA, I had the opportunity to work on a UI/UX project to design an app that would help indecisive travelers discover a destination customized to their unique traits and preferences.</p>
              <p>The app, <em>Travel To Find Our True Selves</em> (<em>TravelTHOTS</em> for short), includes a detailed questionnaire and supports an ecosystem of authentic travel reviews to personalize the trip planning experience. </p>

        <h5>GETTING STARTED</h5>
        <h3>Why travel?</h3>
        <p>COVID-19 has led to <mark>significant <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/06/initial-impact-of-covid-19-on-travel-tourism-outdoor-recreation-varied-widely-across-states.html" target="_blank">declines</a> in travel</mark> due to restrictions: At the onset of the pandemic, employees working in travel, tourism and outdoor recreation experienced up to <mark>40% of earnings losses</mark> at the start of the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same time in 2019. During this period, we hypothesized that potential and seasoned travelers would experience an increased yearning for travel, along with a desire for an app to plan their future, post-COVID trips.</p>

    <div id="problem" class="div-section">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h5>THE PROBLEM</h5>
        <h3>No travel app currently allows users to select and plan a trip in one place, customized to their preferences.</h3>
        <p>Although various travel companion apps exist, travelers must use them in tandem in order to gain access to all the capabilities they may want. Additionally, travel safety information is provided by the US State Department, but the website exists outside of travel planner apps. Our app would centralize all the information and capabilities users might need.</p>

      </div>

    <div id="solution" class="div-section">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h5>THE SOLUTION</h5>
        <h3>A personalized app to help travelers select a destination based on their unique traits and preferences.</h3>
        <p>Existing travel apps such as Lonely Planet and Expedia require users to select a destination before planning their trip and often <mark>provide only generalized recommendations </mark>, while <mark>lacking personalization and authenticity.</mark> Users are expected to know exactly where they want to go from the start, despite the multitude of factors involved in making a decision. Moreover, the options these apps tout are often pricey and touristy.</p>
        <p>In response to these problems, we developed a mobile application called <mark><em>TravelTHOTS (Travel To Find Our True Selves)</em>, a system that helps travelers narrow down an ideal travel location based on their unique preferences,</mark> including crowd level and COVID cases among other relevant niches. <em>TravelTHOTS</em> helps reduce the stress of finding travel destinations and authentic recommendations, all in a customized and efficient way.</p>

        <h3>Initial research</h3>
        <p>Our research involved a three-pronged process of reading existing literature about travel apps, using select travel apps ourselves, and engaging with active travelers about their experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Gaining insights from travelers</h3>
        <p>To understand the underlying factors that influence travelers' trip-planning experiences, we conducted eight <mark>1-1 interviews</mark> with both seasoned and inexperienced travelers. These interviews revealed five key concerns travelers have when planning travel experiences:</p>

            <h3>Modeling</h3>
            <p>We created several flow models to represent the big-picture flow of work as determined by the above concerns. In our current practice flow model,  we identified our primary work roles of travelers and locals and mapped the flow of work activities between these work roles and our app. As indicated in the flow model, both locals and travelers input data into the app algorithm, which returns travel recommendations based on a consolidation of these inputs.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest hurdles we faced was <mark>finding appropriate users</mark> who could participate in our research.

          <ol>
            <li><mark><strong>Building a social network.</strong></mark>While our design incorporates a user discussion forum, it can incorporate other social capabilities such as private messaging and sub-communities to enhance the user experience.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>System security and scalability.</strong></mark> Given the confidential information shared in the app, ensuring that users' data is protected would be one of our top priorities. Additionally, the app would be developed to store a large amount of information as the number of users increases.</li>
