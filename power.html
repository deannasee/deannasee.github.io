        <h5>THE CASE</h5>
        <h3>College students don’t see the Meta Quest 2 as a college essential.</h3>
        <p>The Meta Quest 2 is a groundbreaking VR headset, offering a large library of virtual experiences at an affordable price of <mark>$299</mark>. With Meta’s recent investment into the metaverse, Meta Quest aims to become part of a college student’s day-to-day life. However, more work needs to be done to change existing perceptions that VR is just for gaming.</p>
        <p>Hence, our challenge is to design a strategic and creative campaign showing college students that the Quest 2 is a <mark>social, entertainment, and productivity essential.</mark></p>

        <h5>OUR PITCH</h5>
        <h3>The Meta Quest 2 empowers students to take charge of their time.</h3>
        <p>Unlike smartphones, using the Meta Quest 2 comes hand in hand with <mark>intentionality</mark>. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media, college students make a deliberate choice the moment they put on the headset. This puts them in the mindset for taking charge of the experiences they engage in.</p>
        <p>We saw this moment of taking charge as a campaign opportunity – with the Meta Quest 2, college students have the power to lead more mindful and active lives. Hence, our campaign revolves around (1) <mark>educating college students about VR and Meta Quest</mark>, and (2) empowering experiences that showcase the <mark>full range of the Quest 2’s capabilities.</mark></p>

        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>I conducted user and expert research comprising interviews, longitudinal studies, and synthesizing gathered data. During our design process, I used the insights gained from this research to inform my design of the digital activation, video spot, and other creative executions.</p>

        <h2>I. Research Phase</h2>
        <h3>A collaborative process</h3>
        <p>To understand college students’ behavior and predict how they might integrate the Meta Quest 2 in their lives, we not only sought college students’ opinions of the product through surveys and interviews, but also conducted a longitudinal study where we worked closely with a small pool of students to truly understand their needs—and how Meta Quest 2 could fulfill some of these needs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="pt-exp" class="div-section bg-light">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h3>Understanding the college experience</h3>
        <p>We began by gathering secondary research on college students, defining categories that this target audience strongly identifies with.</p>
        <p>We then conducted thirteen 1-on-1 interviews with students, including trying on the headset, to understand their impressions of Meta Quest 2 and VR. Examples of questions we asked included:</p>
          <br><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“What do you already know about Meta Quest 2/VR?"</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"If you could design the perfect VR headset, what would you be able to do on it?"</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[After trying on the headset] "What was your most/least favorite part of using the Meta Quest 2?"</p></blockquote><br>
        <p>In conjunction with interviews, we had students map out their daily schedules on pie charts. This helped us <mark>identify blocks of time in the target’s day</mark> that could be adapted for using the Meta Quest 2.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="longi" class="div-section">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h3>Longitudinal Study</h3>
        <p>We closely tracked how 7 participants engaged with VR experiences in the headset over 5 weeks. Over the course of this study, we monitored participants’ immediate reactions in the headset, as well as a weekly log of their emotions and behaviors throughout each day. </p>
        <p>After each week, we synthesized the data into key insights which outlined common sentiments and concerns from participants.</p>
        <p>Through the extensive feedback we gathered, we discovered that students were most <mark>embarrassed of mindlessly scrolling</mark> on their phones, and this was directly contrasted by the excitement they expressed when they actively engaged with VR on the Meta Quest 2. This key insight became our "north star" as we progressed into the first stages of design.</p>

        <h3>Digital Activations</h3>
        <p>Our team went through several iterations of individual and group ideating before coming up with our digital executions. They ultimately took the form of social media ads and augmented reality (AR) filters. The Instagram Carousel ads encourage participation from the user, who swipes through a series of GIFs showing the benefits of VR experiences over phone-scrolling. The AR filters show the user demos of VR experiences that they can insert themselves into in real time. These activations break the mindlessness of doom-scrolling, creating a strong association between intentionality and VR experiences on the Meta Quest 2.</p>

        <h3>PR stunt</h3>
        <p>Building on the same idea of <mark>stopping mindless scrolling</mark> as shown in the above executions, we brainstormed a PR stunt on college campuses that would pique students' curiosity of the Meta Quest 2 and lead them to try-on opportunities, increasing Meta Quest's brand awareness.</p>
        <p>Meta Quest ambassadors, or 'Adventure Guides', will approach students looking down at their phones and hand them an invitation to a mystery location at a specific time. This location will be revealed to be a Meta Quest 'Power Box', a pop-up where invited students can try out various VR experiences in the supplied trial headsets.</p>

        <h3>Out-of-home</h3>
      <p>At select campus bus stops, Meta Quest will employ projectors, speakers, and lights in order to give students scrolling on their phones an immersive experience, showing them <mark>what they could be missing by looking down</mark>.</p>
        <p>The bus stops will be equipped with sensors that can detect when a person’s head is down or their phone screen is on. Once this registers, it will trigger the projectors and speakers to switch on, building one of 10 pre-programmed immersive experiences on the walls of the bus stop. These experiences will cover different aspects of student interests (social, educational, creative, gaming) to drive home the idea that <mark>leisure doesn’t have to equate to scrolling, and VR doesn’t have to equate to gaming.</mark></p>

          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>To evaluate this campaign’s effectiveness, we conducted preliminary research for feedback, showing college students the campaign and asking how it made them feel about Meta Quest 2.</p>
        <p>When asked “how likely would you be to purchase a Quest 2 headset for yourself?” with 1 being not at all likely and 7 being very likely, before the campaign, the average score is 3, while post campaign it increased to 5, which is a 67% increase in perceived purchase likelihood. 
          Hence, I am confident in our campaign’s effectiveness and reaching our campaign objectives. With this campaign, Meta Quest 2 gives college students the power to: </p>

          <ul>
            <li><mark>Stop the scroll</mark> by grabbing their attention through bold print and video ads, as well as exciting PR stunts to generate awareness about the brand.</li>
            <li><mark>Gain new experiences</mark> through experiential executions and headset giveaways that enable physical try-ons, showcasing the immersive power of virtual reality.</li>
            <li><mark>Take charge of their tech</mark> and see the Meta Quest 2 as an empowering way to take back leisure “me” time. </li>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges of creating a campaign for Meta Quest 2 is that unlike mature brands, this campaign had to involve educating the consumer about VR and Meta Quest before diving into the Meta Quest 2's functionalities.</p>
          <p>From a strategy and design perspective, it was also challenging to create executions that highlighted the headset while also showcasing authentic VR experiences.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
          <p>At the end of this semester-long sprint, these are some important lessons I learned:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><mark><strong>Design is an ongoing dialogue.</strong></mark> It is a collaborative process that can always be improved upon with suggestions from the client and co-designers, especially as needs and limitations change over time.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Gather feedback from a large sample size.</strong></mark> There is more than one type of college student, and engaging with as many students as possible casts a wider net for different accommodations that need to be made to maximize this campaign's reach among the target audience.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Think "big idea".</strong></mark> During the iterative phase of brainstorming creative strategy, always return to key insights to build executions upon, and focus less on details like color and typeface in the early stages.</li>
          </ol>
