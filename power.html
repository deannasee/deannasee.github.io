        <h5>THE CASE</h5>
        <h3>College students don’t see the Meta Quest 2 as a college essential.</h3>
        <p>The Meta Quest 2 is a groundbreaking VR headset, offering a large library of virtual experiences at an affordable price of <mark>$299</mark>. With Meta’s recent investment into the metaverse, Meta Quest aims to become part of a college student’s day-to-day life. However, more work needs to be done to change existing perceptions that VR is just for gaming.</p>
        <p>Hence, our challenge is to design a strategic and creative campaign showing college students that the Quest 2 is a <mark>social, entertainment, and productivity essential.</mark></p>

        <h5>OUR PITCH</h5>
        <h3>The Meta Quest 2 empowers students to take charge of their time.</h3>
        <p>Unlike smartphones, using the Meta Quest 2 comes hand in hand with <mark>intentionality</mark>. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media, college students make a deliberate choice the moment they put on the headset. This puts them in the mindset for taking charge of the experiences they engage in.</p>
        <p>We saw this moment of taking charge as a campaign opportunity – with the Meta Quest 2, college students have the power to lead more mindful and active lives. Hence, our campaign revolves around (1) <mark>educating college students about VR and Meta Quest</mark>, and (2) empowering experiences that showcase the <mark>full range of the Quest 2’s capabilities.</mark></p>

        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>I conducted user and expert research comprising interviews, longitudinal studies, and synthesizing gathered data. During our design process, I used the insights gained from this research to inform my design of the digital activation, video spot, and other creative executions.</p>

        <h2>I. Research Phase</h2>
        <h3>A collaborative process</h3>
        <p>To understand college students’ behavior and predict how they might integrate the Meta Quest 2 in their lives, we not only sought college students’ opinions of the product through surveys and interviews, but also conducted a longitudinal study where we worked closely with a small pool of students to truly understand their needs—and how Meta Quest 2 could fulfill some of these needs.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="pt-exp" class="div-section bg-light">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h3>Understanding the college experience</h3>
        <p>We began by gathering secondary research on college students, defining categories that this target audience strongly identifies with.</p>
        <p>We then conducted thirteen 1-on-1 interviews with students, including trying on the headset, to understand their impressions of Meta Quest 2 and VR. Examples of questions we asked included:</p>
          <br><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“What do you already know about Meta Quest 2/VR?"</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"If you could design the perfect VR headset, what would you be able to do on it?"</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[After trying on the headset] "What was your most/least favorite part of using the Meta Quest 2?"</p></blockquote><br>
        <p>In conjunction with interviews, we had students map out their daily schedules on pie charts. This helped us <mark>identify blocks of time in the target’s day</mark> that could be adapted for using the Meta Quest 2.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="longi" class="div-section">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h3>Longitudinal Study</h3>
        <p>We closely tracked how 7 participants engaged with VR experiences in the headset over 5 weeks. Over the course of this study, we monitored participants’ immediate reactions in the headset, as well as a weekly log of their emotions and behaviors throughout each day. </p>
        <p>After each week, we synthesized the data into key insights which outlined common sentiments and concerns from participants.</p>
        <p>Through the extensive feedback we gathered, we discovered that students were most <mark>embarrassed of mindlessly scrolling</mark> on their phones, and this was directly contrasted by the excitement they expressed when they actively engaged with VR on the Meta Quest 2. This key insight became our "north star" as we progressed into the first stages of design.</p>

        <h3>Digital Activations</h3>
        <p>Our team went through several iterations of individual and group ideating before coming up with our digital executions. They ultimately took the form of social media ads and augmented reality (AR) filters. The Instagram Carousel ads encourage participation from the user, who swipes through a series of GIFs showing the benefits of VR experiences over phone-scrolling. The AR filters show the user demos of VR experiences that they can insert themselves into in real time. These activations break the mindlessness of doom-scrolling, creating a strong association between intentionality and VR experiences on the Meta Quest 2.</p>

        <h3>PR stunt</h3>
        <p>Building on the same idea of <mark>stopping mindless scrolling</mark> as shown in the above executions, we brainstormed a PR stunt on college campuses that would pique students' curiosity of the Meta Quest 2 and lead them to try-on opportunities, increasing Meta Quest's brand awareness. Meta Quest ambassadors, or 'Adventure Guides', will approach students looking down at their phones and hand them an invitation to a mystery location at a specific time. This location will be revealed to be a Meta Quest 'Power Box', a pop-up where invited students can try out various VR experiences in the supplied trial headsets.</p>

        <h3>Out-of-home</h3>
      <p>At select campus bus stops, Meta Quest will employ projectors, speakers, and lights in order to give students scrolling on their phones an immersive experience, showing them <mark>what they could be missing by looking down</mark>.</p>
        <p>The bus stops will be equipped with sensors that can detect when a person’s head is down or their phone screen is on. Once this registers, it will trigger the projectors and speakers to switch on, building one of 10 pre-programmed immersive experiences on the walls of the bus stop. These experiences will cover different aspects of student interests (social, educational, creative, gaming) to drive home the idea that <mark>leisure doesn’t have to equate to scrolling, and VR doesn’t have to equate to gaming.</mark></p>

            <li>Eliminate redundant medical lab tests, and prevent the loss or chasing down of records</li>

          <h3>Project challenges</h3>
          <p>One of the most challenging constraints was <mark>having to work within UHN’s legacy systems and their server's inability to handle large amounts of data.</mark> With over 50,000 users registered to the UHN patient portal, some features (largely related to processing queries and storing user input) were just not possible to scale—for example, allowing patients to view their entire history of results beyond the last 24 months, or allowing users to save their own report annotations.</p>
          <p>Because of these limitations, we were forced to think about the necessity of certain features and the impact it might have on overall patient experience. We had to <mark>explore alternative solutions</mark> to features that were deemed necessary, while keeping in mind the scalability and adaptability of our designs for future phases of the project.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
          <p>At the end of my internship, I left with some key takeaways and lessons learned from this project:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><mark><strong>Design is never done.</strong></mark> It is an iterative process that can always be improved upon with feedback, especially as objectives, needs, and constraints change over time.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Design is easily biased</strong></mark> from the way user research is conducted, so it is important to be aware of these biases. There is often more than one type of user, and design should always try to accommodate these different user groups.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Design is about compromise.</strong></mark> Finding a balance between satisfying stakeholder wants/needs and user wants/needs is key. Design must drive value not only to users as individuals, but also back to the organization as a system. Especially in an industry like healthcare, sometimes what users think is best for them may not actually be the case.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Design constraints are important to understand as early as possible.</strong></mark> However, while technical feasibility of the present should always be taken into consideration, designing for the future is how innovation can be realized.</li>
          </ol>
