              <p>In my first 4 months at <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com/services/customer-experience-design" target="_blank">Publicis Sapient</a>, I had the opportunity to participate in a company-wide global accessibility hackathon called enABLED Through Tech. enABLE aims to promote accessibility as a core principle of experience design, and encourages teams to instill this value in their day-to-day work for clients.</p>
              <p>My team chose to focus on helping those with visual impairments navigate through essential daily activities, like shopping for groceries, where it can be especially difficult to do safely during COVID-19 times. We were one of 6 teams invited to pitch and present our prototype demo during the week of <a href="https://idpwd.org/" target="_blank">International Day of Disabled Persons (IDPD).</a></p>

        <h2>Meet Tyler</h2>
        <p>Tyler is a musician and photographer based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He is actively involved in the local community and is well known as DJ and owner of a popular downtown social club. Tragically, <mark>Tyler lost his vision over the course of 9 months</mark> and had to quickly adapt, learning how to navigate the world through sound and touch.</p>
        <p><mark>With the onset of COVID-19, Tyler's challenges multiplied.</mark> Previously difficult tasks such as grocery shopping are now even more burdensome, due to restrictions on physical interactions and limitations of current technology.</p>

        <p>We designed GoodGuide​ with Tyler and people like him in mind, to make their trips to the grocery store a little less daunting. We met with Tyler to understand his pain points and experiences coping with 9 months of gradual vision loss, and how it has affected his ability to grocery shop independently.</p>

        <h2>Design Sprint</h2>
        <p>We had limited time to work on this hackathon (which we were juggling on top of our regular work commitments), so our design process was admittedly messy and rushed. But we did manage to run a pseudo-design sprint using <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/publicissapient7269/m/publicissapient7269/1602184873562/6499cce5566619dfa3f113955510a828a059d34d" target="_blank">a MURAL board</a>, where we roughly documented our thought process throughout, including research questions/notes, persona development, opportunity areas, brainstorming and rough sketches.</p>

        <p>Below is a storyline we pitched that follows Tyler on a typical weekly grocery shopping trip, and shows how GoodGuide can help him at each step of his journey.</p>

        <h3>1. Planning</h3>
        <p>Tyler would like​ to bake chocolate chip cookies this weekend, so he ​​adds chocolate chips​ to his shopping list through the voice assistant, and ​​GoodGuide automatically ​sorts his list by category.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“I’m planning on baking some cookies this weekend – I have to buy some chocolate chips and restock on butter. I’ll add that to my weekly shopping list and then I’ll be good to go.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>2. Arrival</h3>
        <p>Once Tyler ​arrives at the store, ​GoodGuide detects​ which shop he is at, and automatically optimizes his in-store shopping route based on this store’s layout to get all the items on his list.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“I hope the chocolate chips are where they usually are, sometimes they shift things around when there are promotions. It throws me off when items are out of their usual places.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>3. Navigation</h3>
        <p>Through in-app​ audio cues, ​​ GoodGuide offers Tyler​ step-by-step instructions and 360 degree audio pings to guide him towards his first item, chocolate chips, via bluetooth beacons placed throughout the store. ​Once Tyler reaches the aisle, he holds up his phone to scan a ​QR code​. Goodguide reads out the list of items in that aisle. Great, the chocolate chips will be to his right.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“Thankfully the chocolate chips are in their usual aisle. Last time I was looking for almond slivers, and instead of being in the baking aisle, they were moved to the snacks and nuts aisle!”</p></blockquote>

            <p>After picking up the chocolate chips, Tyler follows​ goodguide to the next item on his list, thinking ahead to the smell of the freshly baked cookies he’ll be enjoying on the weekend.</p>

        <h2>Channel Optimization</h2>
        <p>I was so proud of our team for what we were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time, not just in how we placed, but what we learned throughout the process. My main goal going into the hackathon was to <mark>simply learn more about designing for accessibility</mark>–and that I did! Here's what I learned:</p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li><mark><strong>Check your assumptions. Beware of unconscious biases.</strong></mark> During one feedback session, our accessibility mentor pointed out that we had a button labelled “View list”–and of course, a person who is non-sighted would not be “viewing” the list. I was so surprised that we didn’t catch this small detail...evidently, there are a lot of assumptions we make subconsciously when we design day-to-day, without realizing how it might impact those who are visually impaired (or have other disabilities). It’s hard, but being more aware of these unconscious biases is definitely something that should be practiced.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Think service-level, not product-level.</strong></mark> Accessibility considerations shouldn’t just live within the product you’re designing. It’s important to take a service-level view of the entire experience or journey–from how the person can access your product in the first place, to how they will use it in certain environments. For example–before deciding to design an app, we had to ask ourselves how accessible a mobile phone would be for the visually impaired. Was a smartphone even something they relied on regularly? Could we assume most people had them? Or for audio features–was this a feasible thing to rely on in noisier store environments?</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Designing for accessibility means a better experience for everyone.</strong></mark> There’s a misconception that designing for accessibility means improving the experience for only a small portion of the population (in this case, the visually impaired). But this is not the case! Everyone can benefit from accessible design. While designing GoodGuide, we realized that even sighted people have trouble navigating in stores sometimes–and that something like GoodGuide could really make grocery shopping more efficient for everyone.</li>
          </ol>
